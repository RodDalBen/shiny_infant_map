# rshinylady

Before running this app, install meetupr from lucy's branch

```r
devtools::install_github("rladies/meetupr", ref = "lucy")`
```

then get a meetup API key and set it as an environmental variable

```r
Sys.setenv(MEETUP_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")`
```

The result should look like the screenshot below.
