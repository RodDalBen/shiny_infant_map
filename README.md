# **ManyBabies** member dashboard

This is the [member dashboard](https://rodrigodalben.shinyapps.io/shiny_mb_map/) for the [**ManyBabies**](https://rodrigodalben.github.io/) project.

To access the MB member database when running the app locally, you will need permisson from the [Governing Board](mailto:manybabies-gb@mailman.stanford.edu).

An OAuth authentication is also necessary. Check this [tutorial](https://josiahparry.com/post/2020-01-13-gs4-auth/) on how to setup one.
