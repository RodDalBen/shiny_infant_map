# **Map/Dashboard** of infant researchers

This is a crowdsourced [dashboard](ADD LINK) listing infant researchers (and labs) across the world.

To access database, when running the app locally, you will need to email the curators: [Christina Bergmann](mailto:chbergma@gmail.com), [Rodrigo Dal Ben](mailto:dalbenwork@gmail.com).

An OAuth authentication is also necessary. Check this [tutorial](https://josiahparry.com/post/2020-01-13-gs4-auth/) on how to setup one.
